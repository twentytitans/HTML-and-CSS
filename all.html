     <h2>Victory for <span id="india">India</span> as UK Changes <span id="vaccine">Vaccine Certificate</span> Policy for Indians</h2>
     <img src="./images/banner.png" alt="Poster for UK accepting Indian Covid Certificate">
     <p>The travellers who have had their
        second doses — of Covishield or
        
        another UK-approved vaccine — at least
        14 days before landing in the UK will not
        be required to take a pre-departure
        Covid test or the day 8 test following
        
        their arrival.</p>
     <p>The decision came hours after MEA spokesperson
        Arindam Bagchi described the UK’s earlier decision to
        quarantine fully vaccinated Indians as “discriminatory”.
        
        British high commissioner to India Alex Ellis tweeted on
        Thursday night: <br> “No quarantine for Indian travellers to UK
        fully vaccinated with Covishield or another UK-approved
        vaccine from October 11. Thanks to Indian government
        
        for close cooperation over last month.”</p>
